bash-config
===========

Unix/Linux environment configuration scripts for interactive and non-interactive shell startup varying by operating system and host.

Configurations are included for Bash, Git, HTop, Java, Python, Tmux, and Vim.

Installation
------------

These files can be installed automatically with the setup.sh script.  It automatically backs up files that it is replacing.

    $ ./setup.sh

Differences between these files and the current system configuration can be found using the diff.sh script.

    $ ./diff.sh

Java Configuration
------------------

Java configurations often vary by host and JDK version, so these are likely to never exactly match the base in this project.

So to configure individual systems.
  1. Create or update the `~/.java-JDK*.cfg` scripts to reflect the local JDK location.
  1. Modify the appropriate local copy of `~/.java-X.cfg` to point the `~/.java-JDK*.cfg` script.

Bash Startup Notes
------------------

The bash startup sequence on login is:                                                 
  1. Execute `/etc/profile`.
  1. Execute the first file found of `~/.bash_profile`, `~/.bash_login`, or `~/.profile`.

The behaviors included here are:
  1. `~/.bash_profile` will run `~/.bashrc`.
  1. `~/.bashrc` will run `~/.bashrc.OS` and `~/.bashrc.HOSTNAME`.

Reference
---------

From "man bash"

> When bash is invoked as an interactive login shell,  or  as  a  non-interactive
> shell  with  the  --login option, it first reads and executes commands from the
> file /etc/profile, if that file exists.  After reading that file, it looks  for
> ~/.bash_profile,  ~/.bash_login,  and  ~/.profile, in that order, and reads and
> executes commands from the first one that exists and is readable.  The --nopro‐file
> option may be used when the shell is started to inhibit this behavior.
>
> When  a  login  shell  exits,  bash  reads  and executes commands from the file
> ~/.bash_logout, if it exists.
>
> When an interactive shell that is not a login shell is started, bash reads  and
> executes  commands  from  /etc/bash.bashrc and ~/.bashrc, if these files exist.
> This may be inhibited by using the --norc option.   The  --rcfile  file  option
> will   force   bash   to  read  and  execute  commands  from  file  instead  of
> /etc/bash.bashrc and ~/.bashrc.
